## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

-I have learned how button hover and focus states changes using CSS its quite nice ,here i'm using "box-shadow" property infact there r so many ways for doing this button hover states but I have done this way:D

-Another property also used quite nicely "overflow:hidden" ,when i'm setting border-radius to whole container its not reflect when i have set this "overflow" property then its nicely work ,if any struggle for doing this you can see my code snippets:D

```css
.btn-1:hover,
.btn-1:focus {
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 2px var(--primary-white-all);
}
.container {
  overflow: hidden;
  border-radius: 0.6rem;
}
```

### Continued development

-Yes i'm really want to learn perfect from basic's to advance of HTML,CSS and Javascript,
-I'm shure with help of "FrontendMentor" i will learn all above mentioned in future projects.
-I want to focus on Javascript logics and HTML/CSS coding as well
